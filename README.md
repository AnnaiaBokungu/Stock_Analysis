# Stock_Analysis
## Overview of Project 
  The purpose of the current analysis was to create a code that run more efficiently to provide quicker results. We refactored the code associated with the solution on a previous module and recorded the amount of time it took for the software to efficiently perform what it was asked to. Upon refactoring, we determined whether or not our edits were successfull based on the time we recorded after running the code for the stock analysis of 2017 and 2018.

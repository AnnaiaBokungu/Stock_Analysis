# Stock_Analysis
## Overview of Project 
  The purpose of the current analysis was to create a code that run more efficiently to provide quicker results. We refactored the code associated with the solution on a previous module and recorded the amount of time it took for the software to efficiently perform what it was asked to. Upon refactoring, we determined whether or not our edits were successfull based on the time we recorded after running the code for the stock analysis of 2017 and 2018.
### Results 
### Summary
Some of the advantages of refactoring are that they facilitate understanding and allow for a much quicker exesution of software task that would otherwise take a few more seconds to perform. Refactoring also improves system design and makes it easier to find bugs. The latter reason is also one of teh disadvantages of refactoring; it is possible that when we're edititing the old code, we're unintentionally introdusing new errors into our edits that will require further attention. With the refactoring of the original VBA script, we exeperienced several errors that made it difficult to perform the task at hand. However, after sorting the errors out, we were able to run the code in a shorter amount of time.
